		<p>Once upon a time, golden hamster and gray hamster lived in a quiet rural village.</p>

		<p>However, the Golden Hamster loved eating so much that it grew tremendously.</p>

		<p>The surprised gray hamster took the Golden Hamster to the hospital.</p>

		<p>The doctor hamster, who saw the Golden Hamster, pondered for a while and beat the Golden Hamster's chubby belly, saying, "Argh!"</p>

		<p>When doctor Hamster beat the Golden Hamster's belly, the Golden Hamster farted.</p>

		<p>The Golden Hamster has returned to its original size. The reason the size of the Golden Hamster grew was because of the gas filled in the stomach.</p>

		<p>The two hamsters said, "Thank you, doctor!" and headed home.</p>
